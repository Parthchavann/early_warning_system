# Port Configuration Fix

## Issue
The frontend was still trying to connect to port 8000 instead of 8001, causing CORS errors.

## Root Cause
The `.env` file contained `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` which overrode other configurations.

## Fix Applied
Updated the `.env` file to use port 8001:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8001/ws
```

## Note
The `.env` file is gitignored for security reasons, so this change needs to be applied manually in each environment.

## Current Configuration Summary
- Backend Server: Port 8001 (`simple_server.py`)
- Frontend API URL: Port 8001 (`.env` file)
- Frontend Proxy: Port 8001 (`package.json`)
- Frontend Dev Server: Port 3000 (default React)

All components are now properly configured to use port 8001 for the backend API.
